**SIRAD Institute for Research and Development**, a leading civil society organization, is committed to uniting communities and developing sustainable, evidence-based solutions for peace and social cohesion.

As part of this mission, SIRAD conducted a workshop titled **"Echoes of Ethiopia: Interethnic Youth Dialogue for Peace and Unity,"** engaging students from diverse ethnic backgrounds at Jigjiga University. The workshop aimed to foster harmony, cultivate patriotism, and promote a sense of national unity among youth.

The event also served as a platform to discuss the root causes of ethnic tensions within the university environment, identify early warning signs of conflict, and design practical mechanisms for prevention and de-escalation.

Key insights and recommendations were shared with the Jigjiga University Studentsâ€™ Union and the Jigjiga Administration to strengthen collaborative efforts in maintaining peace and enhancing student cohesion.
