              <h3>Inter-Party Dialogue  Under Irish Aid Funded Project</h3>
              <p>With support from Irish Aid, SIRAD is implementing an Inter-Party Dialogue Platform in the Somali Region to promote peaceful political engagement and inclusive governance. This initiative has successfully established a six-party political forum that fosters regular dialogue among registered political parties, including the ruling party. The platform has helped reduce tensions, promote understanding, and resolve conflicts through discussion. In partnership with the National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE), the forum aligns with ongoing political and electoral reforms, enhancing its credibility and keeping parties informed of national developments.</p>

              <h3>Civic-Government Dialogue (Under Irish Aid Funded Project)</h3>
              <p>SIRAD is implementing a Civic-Government Dialogue initiative to strengthen ties between citizens and local government by creating an inclusive space for community engagement. These dialogues promote trust, accountability, and participatory decision-making by involving diverse groups such as women, youth, elders, and persons with disabilities. Citizens voice their concerns on issues like service delivery, security, and social cohesion, while government officials gain valuable insight for responsive policymaking. The initiative also incorporates traditional conflict resolution methods, helping to de-escalate tensions in areas with recurring communal disputes, such as Kebribeyah.</p>

              <h3>FCDOII: Peace by Piece II – Bridging Divides through Research and Dialogue for Inclusive and Sustainable Peace in Ethiopia</h3>
              <p>SIRAD, with support from the FCDO through Conciliation Resources, is implementing the “Peace by Piece II” project in the conflict-affected border areas of Moyale, spanning the Somali and Oromia regions. Aimed at fostering peace and social cohesion between Somali and Oromo communities, the project addresses deep-rooted tensions driven by resource conflicts and political marginalization. Using a multi-track approach, it includes community-based conflict mapping, cross-community dialogue forums, and the formation of joint peace committees for conflict prevention and resolution. The initiative also engages policymakers and promotes narrative change through storytelling and youth-led cultural campaigns to counter hate speech and ethnic stereotypes.</p>
